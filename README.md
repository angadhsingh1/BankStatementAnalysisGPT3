# BankStatementAnalysisGPT3
This is my personal project where I plan on creating a Bank Statement analyzer using Chat GPT

Goal -
Aim to for the user to be able to upload thier bank statements in pdf format. This application will read from the pdf file and return csv file with analysis of their expenditure summary for the entered month. 


Project Plan - 
1. Reading the pdf document to fetch details from the pdf. - Done
2. Filter the data read and remove the unwanted infromation read from the PDF. - Done
3. Using the ChatGPT API to analyze and categorize the data. - In progrses
4. Fetch back the result and store the result in csv file.
5. Create a basic web application that integrates this application online using REST API.
6. Modify web applicaiton to allow user upload pdf of their bank statement and return a pdf of their monthly exepense analysis.
